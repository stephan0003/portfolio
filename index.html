          <img id="profile-pic" src="imgs/profile-pic.jpg" alt="profile-pic" />
          <p id="bio__text">
            I am currently in my fourth year of a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. I am in Concordia's
CO-OP 3 internship program to familiarize myself with the aerospace and automotive
fields to see which ones would suit me best.

Aside from school, I am currently a volunteer teacher at my high school, Sourp Hagop. I
have been a student there since 5th grade and have in recent years started teaching there,
as I believe our Christianity plays a huge role in who we are as Armenians. At 6th grade
graduation, I had received the “Mesrob Mashdots” prize for my involvement in the
Armenian community offered by the Armenian Relief Society’s “Sose” association. I
remained part of all these societies all through high school and stayed with the Sunday
School after we were no longer offered “Կրօն” classes as it really completed my Armenian
education and not just my high school education. Furthermore, I have officially become a
member of the Sourp Hagop Armenian Church and attended my first meeting on October
22nd
.

As far as work or internships are concerned, I have continued working on a Part-
Time/Full-Time basis at Ranger Design as a project engineer where I design new
products and test them as well as managing non-compliances of products. After talks with
my Department VP, I have successfully gotten word that I am to have a permanent
position post-graduation. This news brings me one step closer to my personal career
goals.

              The thermoelectric generator challenge project consists of building a vehicle using 4 main components, a Peltier device, a DC servo motor, and a single wick heat source or a tea light candle in this case and a cold source. The vehicle must complete two key challenges to successfully beat the challenge. It must first travel a one-meter strip and then climb a 36” long incline ramp at a 20o angle. The vehicle runs as follows: A heat source and a cold source are set on each side of the Peltier device. The higher the temperature differential between the faces of the Peltier device, the higher the voltage generated will be to run the motor. After a lot of testing, a simple solution was determined. Our vehicle runs a typical rear-wheel-drive setup. An ice bath on top, and candle on the bottom sandwich the Peltier device. This setup generates a consistent 2V which gets our vehicle to move all the way to the top of the ramp.

              The comparison of the three separate preliminary designs for a miniature hovercraft will be analyzed. Only one of the three designs will be proposed to be used in the final design. The hovercraft must be able to autonomously navigate a circuit while hovering at least 3 centimeters off of the ground. The selected design was chosen on the SWOT, WOT, and AHP analysis between the three designs. Certain criteria were given different levels of priority depending on what the team believed will achieve the goals of the hovercraft to complete the circuit. The selected design also respects all specifications and requirements that have been defined by the outline of this project. The selected design was picked by the team based on calculations, testing and simulation with the use of matlab. The project itself will also be presented under the point of view of the schedule, illustrating all tasks that were completed and how they relate to one another; aiding the team to better work around deadlines. The risk management and contingency presents the main problems that occurred during the project with the hovercraft and how the team managed to solve the issues.
